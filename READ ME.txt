Built to Android 25 because Roboelectric does not support API 26 yet

I would usually write more tests, covering all aspects of my code. But given this is just a sample coding app I only wrote a few sample tests. Future work would be to add 100% coverage.

Known issues:
There is an issue with the network async task for getting the thumbnails.
If you go back and forth out of albums viewing multiple thumbnail lists in quick succession, it will continue loading them in order of how the user viewed them.
Future work would be to fix this, cancelling and removing the async tasks when the activity ends.
The code does not load the thumbnails efficiently, it has to load them all before it shows them. Causes a poor user experience if the user rotates the device whilst they are still loading. Would like to improve this, using cache's.
There are no checks in the network classes for the status code to make sure the request was successful. This should be added.
